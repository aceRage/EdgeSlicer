// The decisions behind the FlashForge LAN "Test connection" and "Diagnostics" buttons, kept free of
// wx, the filesystem, the network and FlashNetwork.dll so they can be tested on their own.
//
// Why this file exists at all: the FlashForge device tab drives printers through FlashForge's
// closed FlashNetwork.dll. Everything it can tell us about a failure arrives as a bare integer -
// the FNET_* codes in FlashNetwork.h - and every one of those integers reaches a user who has no
// way to look them up. A C5 owner who types one wrong character of the check code gets 1001, which
// says nothing; "serial number or check code rejected" ends the support thread on the spot. The
// map below is the whole point of the connection test, so it is the part that gets tested.
//
// The diagnostics zip has the same shape of problem from the other side: whatever we put in it is
// what the owner has to work from, and one entry - the check code - must never be in it. The
// manifest is built here, as data, so that "the check code never ships" is a unit test and not a
// code-reading exercise.
