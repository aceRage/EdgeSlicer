// Ultra: the G-code archive.
//
// Every file this PC uploads to a printer - from the desktop's own Send / Print dialogs, from the
// Snapmaker preprint page, or from the phone through RemoteSend - is copied into a folder the user
// picks, next to a JSON sidecar saying which printer it went to and what the plate was. The phone's
// "Reprints" tab (stage 2) then has a list it can send again without the project being open.
//
// Rules for callers:
//   * archiving must never fail a send. Everything here swallows its own errors and logs them.
//   * archive() copies the file, so it may be called after the sender has finished with it, but
//     before anything deletes it (the print-host queue removes its temporary source afterwards).
//   * meta_for_plate() reads the plater and the presets and so has to run on the GUI thread; it
//     marshals there itself when called from a worker, so any hook may call it.
