// The "hub": one long-lived helper process per PC (this same executable started with
// --hub) that owns everything a phone or an agent talks to, so it keeps working after the
// slicer window is closed and serves every open slicer instance at once:
//
//   * the token-gated LAN listener on :13640 (phone page, camera list, JSON API),
//   * the bundled go2rtc relay and the Bambu MJPEG relay (camera streams),
//   * the list of running slicer instances (each instance runs a loopback-only JSON API
//     and drops a <pid>.json under <datadir>/hub/instances; the hub proxies
//     /r/<token>/i/<pid>/api/... to it),
//   * uploads from the phone (<datadir>/hub/uploads), opened in an existing instance or
//     in a freshly spawned one.
//
// The first slicer instance that needs it spawns the hub detached; the hub exits on its
// own once phone access is off and no instance has been alive for a minute. State the
// hub needs across restarts (phone on/off, the camera list) lives in
// <datadir>/hub/hub.json and streams.json. The phone link's token lives in settings.json
// next to them, because hub.json is deleted on a clean quit and the link must survive that:
// it is in QR codes people scanned and in home-screen icons they installed.
