// separate --hub process at /r/<token>/). These are the rules that view follows, kept free of wx
// so they can be tested on their own (tests/slic3rutils/hub_home_tests.cpp):
//   * which address it loads (always built from the hub's own /hub/info answer, never a fixed port),
//   * where it may navigate (the hub page only; http(s) links elsewhere go to the system browser),
//   * what a re-check of the hub means for the page on screen (port moved, new link, hub gone),
//   * how the page is told the slicer's theme (?theme= on load, window.__edgeTheme() live).
