// Per-plate print history.
//
// A plate remembers when, where and on which machine it was sent. The list is GUI-free so the
// rules (cap, ordering, which actions turn the plate "printed", when the plate counts as modified
// since its last send) can be unit tested; the GUI side (PartPlate, the history pop-up, the send
// hooks) only feeds it.
//
// Persistence: the list rides in the project 3MF as one <metadata key="edgeslicer_print_history">
// element per plate (JSON value), written only when the list is not empty. A build that does not
// know the key ignores it. See Format/bbs_3mf.cpp.
