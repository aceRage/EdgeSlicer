// fork's erOverSupportPerimeter where it lands on support material. Both are outer wall and both
// must be baked - dropping them punches holes in exactly the overhanging bands where the surface
// matters most. (erPerimeter, the inner walls, is deliberately never read: the bake is solid, so
// everything inward of the outer loop is filled by construction.)

//
// The stored polyline is the extrusion's CENTRELINE; what the nozzle lays down is that centreline
// swept by the path's own `width`. The printed outer boundary is therefore the centreline offset
// outward by width/2.
//
// The loop is offset as a CLOSED POLYGON, not as a set of open polylines, and this is the trick
// that makes the bake solid. Offsetting the open polylines (what
// ExtrusionPath::polygons_covered_by_width does) sweeps a capsule along each path, and the union
// of those capsules around a closed ring is an ANNULUS - a ring with the object's own cross
// section punched out as a hole. Offsetting the closed polygon instead gives the filled region
// bounded by the outer edge of the wall, which is exactly the printed cross section.
//
// Orientation carries the meaning here, and the union below reads it. A CONTOUR loop runs
// counter-clockwise and its printed region is everything inside it out to width/2 BEYOND the
// centreline: offset the CCW polygon by +width/2. A HOLE loop runs clockwise and the material is
// everything OUTSIDE it, so the void it encloses reaches width/2 INSIDE the centreline: offsetting
// the CW polygon by the same +width/2 grows it along its own (reversed) normal, which is exactly
// the shrink the hole needs, and it stays clockwise. Handing both to a pftNonZero union then makes
// the contours solid and the holes hollow, with no separate bookkeeping.
//
// The width is the loop's own, taken as the MAXIMUM over its outer-wall paths. A loop crossing an
// overhang is split into paths of differing width (overhang flow is not wall flow), and a closed
// offset takes one delta; the larger is the safe choice, since it can only push the boundary out
// by at most the difference - well under a tenth of a millimetre - whereas the smaller would pull

// through the `resolution` simplifier (Douglas-Peucker at the print's own G-code tolerance, 0.01
// mm by default but commonly 0.05-0.1), possibly re-fitted to arcs, and had xy compensation
// applied. A 8 mm cylinder whose slice contour has ~200 points comes out of the perimeter
// generator with ~40, and the bake built on those 40 is visibly faceted next to the preview -
// which draws the arcs, not the chords. That is the owner's "more angular than the slice preview".
//
// LayerRegion::slices is the un-simplified contour the slicer cut from the mesh. The outer wall's
// printed boundary is that contour itself (the wall centreline sits half an external width inside
// it, and the bake offsets the centreline back out by the same half width) - so the boundary is
// recoverable EXACTLY, with none of the simplification in between, by just taking the slice
// contour. The half-width round trip is a no-op and is not performed: offsetting in by w/2 and
// back out by w/2 through Clipper would round every convex corner by w/2 and leave the concave
// ones alone, which is a real distortion introduced for nothing.
//
// What this source CANNOT reproduce is anything the perimeter generator adds to the path after
// the slice: fuzzy skin above all, which is displacement applied to the centreline and has no
// counterpart in the slice contour. A fuzzy bake must use the Extrusion source; the GUI says so
// and the caller chooses.

// The resolution densifier
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// What it is for: even an un-simplified slice contour is a polyline, and the bake's caps and walls
// are built on its points. Where the real surface curves, a long chord between two contour points
// is a visible flat. The densifier splits such a chord - but ONLY where the curvature says a chord
// is standing in for an arc.
//
// The curvature test, and why straight runs are deliberately left alone. Subdividing a straight
// segment adds vertices that carry no shape at all: the new points lie on the line the segment
// already described, so the mesh is identical and only the triangle count grows. On a 100 mm cube
// wall that is tens of thousands of wasted triangles. So each segment is judged by the TURN at its
// two endpoints - the angle between it and its neighbours - which is the polyline's discrete
// curvature. A segment between two collinear neighbours is on a straight run and is kept whole,
// however long. A segment whose neighbours turn away from it is standing in for an arc, and the
// sagitta of that arc is what has to be held under the tolerance.
//
// The sagitta of a circular arc of radius R subtending a chord of length L is
// R - sqrt(R^2 - (L/2)^2) ~= L^2 / (8R) for small L, and the local radius implied by a turn of
// angle `theta` over a segment of length L is R ~= L / theta. So sagitta ~= L * theta / 8, and the
// number of pieces needed to bring it under `tol` is ceil(sqrt(L * theta / (8 * tol))) - the square
// root because halving a chord quarters its sagitta.
//
// Everything is computed in SCALED integer coordinates and the split points are rounded to them,
// which keeps the output on the same lattice as the input: a densified contour's original points
// are bit-identical to the un-densified ones, so nothing downstream (the exact-match cap table,
// the prism weld) has to care whether the densifier ran.

// The pinch fix
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The defect, in one sentence: a layer whose boundary visits the same XY twice makes the cap
// triangulation stitch two unrelated parts of the wall together, and the triangle that does it is a
// millimetres-long zero-area blade lying across the surface.
//
// How a layer comes to visit an XY twice, and why it is not a bug upstream. Two cases, both legal
// Clipper output:
//
//   * a self-touching contour - one closed path that returns to a vertex it already used. Two sharp
//     CONCAVE features of the boundary angling towards each other produce it as soon as their
//     offsets meet, which on a Benchy hull happens all over the deck cutout and the bow. Clipper
//     emits it as a single path because that is what the non-zero fill rule describes; splitting it
//     into two simple paths is what the StrictlySimple flag is for, and simplify_polygons_ex above
//     now asks for it.
//
//   * two SEPARATE rings sharing a vertex - two islands that touch at a point, or a hole whose
//     boundary touches its contour. StrictlySimple does not merge those (they really are two
//     rings), so the shared vertex survives the union, and it is the one that aliases.
//
// The fix for what is left after StrictlySimple: walk every point of the layer and, whenever an XY
// has already been seen, move it by 64 SCALED UNITS - about 60 nanometres - along the bisector of
// its own two edges, away from the point it collided with. That is far below any geometry the
// slicer produces (Clipper's own safety offset is ten scaled units) and far above the spacing a
// float can resolve at the magnitudes a print bed spans (~30 nm at 300 mm), so the two points stay
// distinct all the way into the mesh.
//
// Who still needs this, now that the caps are triangulated by index rather than by coordinate:
// Triangulation::triangulate itself. Its own header says it is "Not working properly for ExPolygons
// with multiple point on same coordinate", and the duplicate-handling path it takes otherwise
// (collect_duplicates / create_changes) merges the coincident points into one - which would weld
// the two sides of a pinch in the CAP while the walls keep them apart. Feeding it a slice with no
// repeated coordinate keeps it on its fast, exact path.
//
// Why nudge rather than drop, merge or weld. Dropping a cap triangle leaves a hole and breaks
// watertightness, which is the one property the whole loft exists to guarantee (measured: a plain
// 20 mm cube went from 0 open edges to 40 when zero-area cap triangles were rejected). Merging the
// two rings changes the topology of the layer. Nudging changes the geometry by an amount no
// measurement in this file can see.

// The loft: one closed prism per layer
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Why not Slic3r::slices_to_mesh, which this bake used first: that loft triangulates the caps
// between consecutive layers from CLIPPER DIFFS (diff_ex(lower, upper) and diff_ex(upper, lower))
// while the vertical walls come from the layer polygons themselves. A diff introduces
// intersection vertices on edges the wall strip has no vertex on, so the two meshes meet along
// edges split on one side and whole on the other - T-junctions, which its_merge_vertices cannot
// weld because the vertices genuinely are not coincident. Its own FIXME says as much
// ("there will be cracks in the output"). A prismatic cube never differs layer to layer and so
// came out clean; a fuzzed cube produced 20,264 open edges and a cylinder 15,245.
//
// What is built instead: each layer is its own CLOSED prism - bottom cap, vertical walls, top cap
// - and every one of the three is generated from the SAME contour point set, so the prism is
// watertight on its own, by construction, with no diff and no tolerance anywhere. Stacking the
// prisms and welding exactly-coincident vertices then gives a mesh whose only remaining internal
// structure is a pair of coplanar, oppositely-wound cap faces between neighbouring layers. Those
// pairs are matched (each is somebody's top and somebody's bottom), so every edge still has an
// even number of incident faces and the result is closed: its_num_open_edges() == 0.
//
// The cost is the coplanar internal faces where two layers overlap. They are the price of never
// needing a diff, and nothing downstream minds: a closed mesh is a closed mesh to TriangleMesh's
// statistics, to the repair path, and to the slicer, which cuts the same contours either way.
//
// The cap triangulation is the existing GLU tesselator. It emits its vertices verbatim from the
// coordinates handed in - the same unscale<double>() the wall vertices use - so a cap vertex can
// be matched back to its contour point by exact double equality. The one case that would not
// match is a tessCombine vertex, which GLU only produces for a self-intersecting contour; the
// union_ex output here is not self-intersecting, and if one ever appeared it is counted into
// report.note rather than silently welded to the wrong place.

// The cap triangulation, and why it is INDEX based rather than coordinate based.
//
// The first version of this loft triangulated the caps with the GLU tesselator
// (triangulate_expolygons_3d) and matched the bare XY coordinates it emits back to the mesh
// vertices the walls had already laid down, through a std::map keyed on the unscaled XY. Two things
// were wrong with that, and together they are the owner's "stray straight slivers" report:
//
//   * The map is only injective if the layer visits every XY at most once. A layer whose boundary
//     touches itself - two sharp concave features angling at each other, which a Benchy's deck
//     cutout and bow are full of - visits one twice, and the map's emplace kept the FIRST entry, so
//     the second visit silently aliased onto the first visit's vertex. The cap triangle that used
//     it was then stitched to a point on the far side of the pinch.
//
//   * Measured on a plate with five 0.55 mm slots, GLU emitted FOUR triangles per cap that span a
//     slot - covering a void with surface that should not be there - on input whose contour is CCW,
//     whose five holes are all CW, which has no repeated coordinate at all and no vertex off the
//     contour. That is GLU getting a valid polygon-with-holes wrong, not a defect in the input, and
//     no amount of cleaning the input fixes it.
//
// Slic3r::Triangulation::triangulate(const ExPolygons &) has neither problem. It is a constrained
// Delaunay triangulation whose constraints are the polygon's own edges, so a triangle can never
// cross one - a void cannot be covered. And it returns INDICES into the ExPolygons' own point list
// rather than coordinates, so there is nothing to match back: the point list is
// `contour, then holes, for each ExPolygon in order` (to_points()), which is exactly the order
// append_layer_prism lays its vertex runs down in, so an index maps to a vertex by adding the run's
// base. No table, no keying on a double, nothing to alias.
//
// What is lost: nothing the bake used. GLU's tessCombine vertices (which the old code had to count
// and drop) cannot arise, because the triangulation adds no points.

// Triangulate ONE island into indices over its own to_points() order, or report that it cannot be

//
// PREFERRED: Slic3r::Triangulation - a constrained Delaunay triangulation (CGAL) returning INDICES
// into the island's own point list. Nothing is matched back by coordinate and no triangle can cross
// a constraint edge, so a void cannot be covered. On the slice-contour source it is flawless: 1002
// Benchy layers, zero dropped triangles, zero open edges.
//
// WHY IT NEEDS A FALLBACK, which took several rounds of measurement to pin down. CGAL's
// Exact_predicates_INEXACT_constructions kernel resolves a hole running within a lattice unit of its
// own contour as a genuine intersection and inserts a vertex at the crossing - a vertex whose
// info() is never assigned, so it returns as an out-of-range index. The extrusion source hits this
// and the slice-contour source does not: a fuzzed wall's outward offset pinches slivers of void
// against their own contours all over a Benchy hull, and those near-contacts are what the inexact
// kernel cannot resolve. Clipper, exact on the integer lattice, sees nothing wrong with them -
// measured, every such island returns from its own union_ex unchanged, ring for ring and to the
// last square micrometre.
//
// AND IT CANNOT BE SCREENED FOR IN ADVANCE. CGAL::spatial_sort shuffles with a RANDOM seed, so
// triangulate() is not a function of its input: probing an island, finding it sound, and then
// triangulating it for real can still fail. An earlier "sanitiser" built on such a probe certified
// nothing and the open-edge count wandered between runs on identical geometry.
//
// FALLBACK: the GLU tesselator for that island, mapped back by coordinate - safe because
// unpinch_slice has already guaranteed the island visits no XY twice. GLU is deterministic and
// always covers the polygon; its own flaw (spanning a void when a polygon has several narrow,
// closely-spaced holes) is rarer and strictly less bad than a hole in the mesh.
//
// LAST RESORT: if GLU also produces a vertex that maps to nothing - a tessCombine vertex, which it
// only emits on self-intersecting input - the island is reported UNTRIANGULABLE. The caller then
// drops its holes and asks again, and builds the walls from that same reduced shape. That is the
// part that matters: an earlier version filled the holes in the cap alone while the walls were
// already built from the unreduced island, which left every filled hole ringed by wall with nothing
// to close against - 1,894 open edges out of 16 dropped triangles. A cap and its walls must come
// from the same geometry or the arithmetic cannot work out.

// What the stepped stack looks like and why one might not want it. Every layer is a prism with
// VERTICAL walls over its own [bottom_z, print_z] band, so a sloped surface comes out as a
// staircase. That is a truthful picture of what the printer lays down, and it is the default. But
// when the bake is a re-sliceable replica of a curved part, the staircase is the one artefact the
// source mesh did not have, and re-slicing it at a finer layer height reproduces the COARSE steps
// rather than the curve. Hence the toggle.
//
// The construction is the same SHAPE of argument as the prism stack, which is what keeps it
// watertight: the Z range is cut into intervals, each interval is built as a solid that is CLOSED
// ON ITS OWN, and the closed solids are stacked and welded. Every edge of a closed solid has two
// incident faces; stacking cannot change that, so the union is closed too, exactly as for the
// prisms. What changes is only what one interval looks like inside.
//
// The intervals are the gaps between the layers' SAMPLE heights:
//
//   z[0]   = bottom_z of the first layer      (so the stack still reaches the bed)
//   z[i]   = the middle of layer i's band     (interior layers)
//   z[n-1] = print_z of the last layer        (so it still reaches the top)
//
// Sampling each interior layer at its MID height is what makes an interval an interpolation of the
// real surface: a slice contour is the cross-section of the part at (roughly) the middle of its
// band, so a straight line between two mid-heights is a chord of the real surface, not a chord
// that has been pushed out to a band edge first.
//
// Interval [z[i], z[i+1]] is built one of two ways:
//
//   RIBBON, when the two layers' rings CORRESPOND - the same number of rings, matched one to one
//     by winding and centroid proximity, and resampled to a common point count (the larger of the
//     two, by arc length) so the strip is a clean run of quads with no T-junctions. The interval
//     is that ribbon, plus a bottom cap over layer i and a top cap over layer i+1. Closed.
//
//   PRISM, otherwise - a hole opening, two islands merging, a ring appearing. Layer i's contour
//     extruded vertically over the whole interval, bottom and top caps both over layer i. Closed.
//     This is precisely the stepped construction applied to one interval, so the fallback is the
//     old behaviour locally and nothing else has to change.

        //                                    share carry three faces, which reads as an open mesh.
        //

        // bisector, which can push one island across another and break (2). union_ex gives (2)
        // exactly on the integer lattice, but it can split an edge at an intersection and land the

        // 9.3e-6 mm^2 - a few square microns - and that was enough for several hundred unbalanced

        // nothing left to do. That order matters: whichever of the two runs last is the one whose
        // invariant survives, and (1) is the one that cannot be re-established afterwards by
        // anything cheap - a duplicate XY sends the triangulation down a path that returns indices
        // into a collapsed point list, with no way to tell from the outside. (2), by contrast, is
        // only broken by a nudge, and a nudge that breaks it moves a point by 60 nm across a
        // boundary the union had just made disjoint - so the loop simply runs again.
