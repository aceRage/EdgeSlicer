// Slice baking, phase 1 ("Exact layers" mode).
//
// Turns a sliced PrintObject's PRINTED APPEARANCE - the outer wall as it will actually be
// extruded, fuzzy skin and all - into a watertight mesh that can be re-sliced. The driving
// scenario is texture transplanting: slice at 0.3 mm WITH fuzzy skin, bake, then re-slice the
// bake at 0.12 mm WITHOUT fuzzy skin and get the same texture printed at a finer layer height.
//
// What is baked: LayerRegion::perimeters, outer loops only (erExternalPerimeter, plus the
// overhang/over-support variants, which are the same physical outer wall split by role), from
// every region of every layer, each loop's polyline offset outward by its own width/2 and
// unioned into one filled ExPolygons per layer. The result is SOLID - the bake is a re-sliceable
// object, not a hollow replica - so top and bottom surfaces come for free from the filled layers
// and the loft's own caps.
//
// What is excluded, by construction rather than by filtering: supports and support interface
// (they live in SupportLayer, never touched), brim and skirt (separate collections on Print /
// PrintObject), the wipe tower (a separate structure on Print), and infill and inner perimeters
// (never read - everything radially inward of the outer loop is filled in anyway).
//
// The loft: each layer becomes its own CLOSED PRISM over its [bottom_z, print_z] band - bottom
// cap, vertical walls, top cap, all three generated from the same contour points - and the prisms
// are stacked and welded on exact vertex equality. This is what makes the bake watertight on
// non-prismatic geometry. The existing Slic3r::slices_to_mesh is deliberately NOT used: it
// triangulates the caps from Clipper diffs of consecutive layers, which puts intersection
// vertices on wall edges that have no vertex there (T-junctions), and its own FIXME says the
// result has cracks. See SliceBake.cpp for the construction and the spec for the measurements.
//
// Deterministic: the layer loop is ordered, the per-layer union is Clipper's (itself
// deterministic for a fixed input ordering), and nothing is hashed or threaded across layers in
// a way that could reorder the output.
//
// Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-slice-bake-research.md (phase 1).
