// Triangle mesh <-> OpenCASCADE B-rep conversion.
//
// mesh_to_brep() follows the approach of Orca-Cad's GeometryEngine::mesh_to_brep
// (github.com/tommasobbianchi/Orca-Cad, AGPL-3.0, itself a port of
// github.com/tommasobbianchi/mesh2step): vertices and edges are SHARED between triangles at
// construction time, so the topology is sewn by construction instead of by a
// BRepBuilderAPI_Sewing pass, and watertightness falls out of the edge-usage counts.
// EdgeSlicer additions: connected components become separate solids, closed inward-facing
// components become cavities of the solid that contains them, open components become shells
// with a warning, and all sub-shape tolerances are set from the mesh's float precision so the
// coplanar merge yields a valid B-rep.
